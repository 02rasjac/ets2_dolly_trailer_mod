# Dolly Trailers for ETS2

This project generates a drawbar configuration (dolly and trailer) for all of Euro Truck Simulator 2's basegames trailers. It is intended to be used with [Devil BDF Tandem Truck Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620915774&searchtext=bdf), but may or may not work with other rigid truck mods.

## Why use this mod

The open trailers in Devils BDF mod doesn't show any visible cargo, which I find very annoying. Since this mod uses the basegames trailer bodies, but only add a dolly as a sub-body, the cargo configurations still works. This means that every cargo that's in the game, as well as modded cargoes that's visible on the basegames trailer, will be visible.
